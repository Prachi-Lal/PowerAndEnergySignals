## Signal:
### In signal processing, a signal is a function that conveys information about a phenomenon. In electronics and telecommunications, it refers to any time varying voltage, current, or electromagnetic wave that carries information. A signal may also be defined as an observable change in a quality such as quantity.

## Discrete Time Signal:
### Discrete time views values of variables as occurring at distinct, separate "points in time", or equivalently as being unchanged throughout each non-zero region of time ("time period")—that is, time is viewed as a discrete variable. Thus a non-time variable jumps from one value to another as time moves from one time period to the next.

## Energy Signal:
### A finite energy signal will have zero TOTAL power. Let’s investigate this statement in detail. When the energy is finite, the total power will be zero. Check out the denominator in the equation for calculating the total power. When the limit N tends to infinity, the energy dilutes to zero over the infinite duration and hence the total power becomes zero.

## Power Signal:
### Signals whose total power is finite and non-zero. The energy of the power signal will be infinite. Example: Periodic sequences like sinusoid. A sinusoidal signal has finite, non-zero power but infinite energy.
